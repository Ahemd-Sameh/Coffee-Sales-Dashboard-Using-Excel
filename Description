formatting using Excel functions and tools.

Data Preparation:
Data Structuring: Organized the data into a structured format suitable for analysis, ensuring that all relevant fields are 
included.
Pivot Tables: Created pivot tables to summarize sales data by different dimensions (e.g., date, coffee type, country, 
customer).

Dashboard Design:
Layout Planning: Designed the layout of the dashboard, deciding on the placement of charts, filters, and other elements 
to ensure a logical flow and easy navigation.
Visual Elements: Added charts and graphs to visualize key metrics:
Line chart for total sales over time by coffee type.
Bar chart for sales distribution by country.
Bar chart for top 5 customers by sales amount.

Filters: Implemented slicers for:
Date selection.
Coffee type (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta).
Roast type (Dark, Light, Medium).
Coffee size (0.2 Kg, 0.5 Kg, 1.0 Kg, 2.5 Kg).
Loyalty card usage.

Interactive Elements:
Date Filter: Enabled users to select specific periods from January 2019 to August 2022 for detailed analysis using a 
timeline slicer.
Dynamic Charts: Ensured that charts and graphs update dynamically based on user selections from the filters and slicers.

Final Touches:
Aesthetic Enhancements: Applied consistent color schemes, fonts, and design elements to enhance the visual appeal of 
the dashboard.
Usability Testing: Conducted usability testing to ensure the dashboard is intuitive and user-friendly, making adjustments 
based on feedback.

Technical Details:
Tools Used: Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, preparation, and visualization.
Functions and Features: Utilized Excel functions (e.g.,XLOOKUP ,VLOOKUP, IF, SUMIFS), pivot tables, slicers, and charts.
Design Considerations: Focused on creating an accessible and visually appealing interface, with a clear emphasis on ease of
 use and readability.

Conclusion:
The Coffee Sales Dashboard is a valuable tool for sales teams, marketing strategists, and business analysts. It provides 
actionable insights that drive informed decision-making, helping to optimize sales strategies and improve overall business
